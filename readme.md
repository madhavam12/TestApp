# Description
Sample app for the test. Did not use locators for dependency injection to keep it simple since it's a smaller project.

# Additional Features

1. A forget password button which resets the password by sending the user an email.
2. A welcome screen with enhanced User-Interface
3. A profile editing page where the user can edit his name & profile photo.
4. A profile page where the user can view her/his profile.
6. Email verification, when registering; the app sends a verification link to the given user's email address to make sure that the user has entered her/his email.
5. Used pagination instead of standard StreamBuilder. This loads data in chunks, thus causing lesser reads & saving money.
